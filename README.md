## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/startup-landing-page.git
   cd startup-landing-page


2. **install dependencies**

3. **run the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
